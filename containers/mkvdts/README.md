# Overview
This is a docker container and script to run the [mkvdts2ac3](https://github.com/JakeWharton/mkvdts2ac3) script in a docker container. This ensures the dependencies get installed appropriately without cluttering the main install.

## TODOs
[ ] Use a git submodule to link directly to https://github.com/JakeWharton/mkvdts2ac3
