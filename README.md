# dotfiles
Personal and portable dotfiles setup. Run `./setup.sh` to run things. This is idempotent and should upgrade anything as necessary.

# Local Customizations
* Add a `.gitconfig.local` file to have machine specific customizations, or environment specific customizations.

# TODO
* [ ] Checkout [nix home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) to manage dotfiles instead
* [ ] Write check script to make sure everything is synced up: Check atom dependencies, brew dependencies, apt dependencies
* [ ] Get work related git config
* [ ] GNUPG config?
* [ ] Ensure fish is setup as the default shell
* [ ] Enable gitconfig.local file with setup instructions
* [ ] Test out kitty + custom kitty profile

## VSCode Setup Portability
* [ ] Stow the vscode Setup
* [ ] `code` install the packages from a list
* [ ] Script to output apm list
